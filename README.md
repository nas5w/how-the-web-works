# How the web works

Short and clear explanations about how the web works. Each article will focus on one piece of tech (or concept) and explain it in a way anyone could understand.

Planned topics (this list will grow):

- [x] Single Page Apps
- [x] Caching
- [ ] Clients and servers
- [ ] HTTP
- [ ] Database
- [ ] Database indexing
- [ ] Signed integers
- [ ] Web page loading
- [ ] APIs
- [ ] Client-side frameworks
- [ ] Encryption at rest / in transit
- [ ] Envelope encryption
- [ ] Continuous integration
- [ ] Automated testing 
- [ ] Web sockets
- [ ] Streaming
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Edge computing
- [ ] DNS
- [ ] Memoization
- [ ] Lazy loading
- [ ] HTTPS 
- [ ] Client-side routing

I also maintain these write-ups (and eventually some audio/video accompaniments) over on substack. I'd appreciate it if you subscribed!
